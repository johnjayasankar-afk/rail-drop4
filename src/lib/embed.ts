 *
 * Two headers decide it, and they do not agree. An enforced CSP with
 * `frame-ancestors` wins over `X-Frame-Options`, but this app's main policy is
 * report-only, and a report-only policy blocks nothing and overrides nothing.
 * So the framing rule ships as its own small enforced policy, and the
 * `X-Frame-Options` header is gone: a `SAMEORIGIN` there would block the frame
 * on its own, which is exactly what was happening.
 *
 * The handshake exists because an embedding page cannot tell a blocked frame
 * from a loaded cross-origin one. Both fire `load`, and the rest of the frame
 * is opaque to the parent by design. The embedding page shows a still by
 * default and reveals the frame only when this message arrives, which a blocked
 * frame can never send because its scripts never run.
